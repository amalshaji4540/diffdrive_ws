# Differential drive robot using ROS2 and ESP32
In this project, we had build a differential drive robot using EPS32 microcontroller. ROS2 humble is used for controlling the robot. Micro-ROS is uses for connecting ESP32 to ROS2 running computer.

[robot_localization](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html) is the package of used for localization of robot. Which is developed by Charles River Analytics, Inc.

diffdrive project is under development
